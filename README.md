#### OS Specific

You are under the FreeBSD branch. Currently I am moving to FreeBSD and trying to get my software run on it.
I didn't test yet if this branch also runs on OpenBSD and NetBSD - I'll test it in the future.

__Supported__: IP Address, Battery status and date
__Not supported yet__: Volume, CPU/Mem usage
